        <h3>Video</h3>
        <p>Video animation is a technique used to create moving images or illustrations using computer software or by drawing each frame by hand. Animations can be used for various purposes such as entertainment, education, marketing, and communication. The process of creating a video animation involves several steps, including storyboarding, scriptwriting, character design, animation, and post-production.

            There are different types of video animation, including 2D animation, 3D animation, motion graphics, and stop-motion animation. 2D animation involves creating images and animations on a two-dimensional plane, while 3D animation creates a three-dimensional environment and objects. Motion graphics combine graphic design, animation, and text to create engaging and informative videos. Stop-motion animation involves taking pictures of objects or characters and moving them slightly between each shot to create the illusion of movement.</p>
